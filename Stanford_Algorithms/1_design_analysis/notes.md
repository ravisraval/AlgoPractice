merge sort has 6nlog(2)n + 6n operations

## Guiding principles of algo analysis
1. use worst-case analysis, as opposed to average-case and benchmarks (generally agreed upon, practical inputs)
2. won't pay attention to constant or lower-order terms
3. Asymptotic analysis - look at large input sizes

- as computers get faster, we'll try to solve tougher problems, and therefore algo analysis is actually more important the faster computers get

Asymptotic analysis: suppress constant factors and lower-order terms

## Divide and conquer paradigm
1. DIVIDE into smaller subproblems
2. CONQUER via recursive calls
