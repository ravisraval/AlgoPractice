# You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.
# To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a hash â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.
#
# Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:
#
#   "After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"
# "Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."
# What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final hash should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 22. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".
#
# Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation.
#
# You could make a reasonable argument to use regex in your solution. We won't, mainly because performance is difficult to measure and can get pretty bad.
