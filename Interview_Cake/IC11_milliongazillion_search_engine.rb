# I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.
# I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.
#
# Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.
#
# How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?

      if !current_node.has_key?(char) #if we haven't seen this before
        is_new_word = true #then we have a new word
        current_node[char] = {} #and this new node's val is a hash
      end
       #move into the thing we just made, or was already there
      current_node = current_node[char]
