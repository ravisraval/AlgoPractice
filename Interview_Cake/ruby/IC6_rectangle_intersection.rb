# A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
# They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.
#
# Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
# Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
#
# As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
#
# They are defined as hashes â†´ like this:
#
#   my_rectangle = {
#
#     # coordinates of bottom-left corner
#     ''left_x'' => 1,
#     ''bottom_y'' => 5,
#
#     # 'width' and 'height'
#     ''width'' => 10,
#     ''height'' => 4,
#
# }
#
# Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
