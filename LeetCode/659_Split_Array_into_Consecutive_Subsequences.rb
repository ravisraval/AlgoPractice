#
# You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
# 1, 2, 3
# 3, 4, 5
# Example 2:
# Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
# 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# 3, 4, 5
# Example 3:
# Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
# Output: False
# Note:
# The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]

end
