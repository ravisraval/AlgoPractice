# You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies
# (which is a list of pairs of projects, where the second project
# is dependent on the first project). All of a project's dependencies
# must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow
# the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order, return
# an error.
#
# EXAMPLE
# Input:
#   projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
#   dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
# Output: f, e, a, b, d, c

#thoughts
#make a tree where children are dependencies - they need parents first
#start from bottom, using dfs to determine heights
#i'm just gonna say that the projects are one letter strings
