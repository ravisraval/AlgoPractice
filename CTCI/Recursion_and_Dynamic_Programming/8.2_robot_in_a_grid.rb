# Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows

# down, but certain cells are 'off limits', such that the robot cannot
# step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from
# the top left to the bottom right.

#need to find a path to [r - 1, c] or [r, c -1], etc.
