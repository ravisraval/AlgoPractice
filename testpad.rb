# Step 1: min_by_key
# Throughout this interview, we'll pretend we're building a new analytical database. Don't worry about actually building a database though â€“ these will all be toy problems.
# Here's how the database works: all records are represented as maps, with string keys and integer values. The records are contained in an array, in no particular order.
# To begin with, the database will support just one function: min_by_key. This function scans the array of records and returns the record that has the minimum value for a specified key. Records that do not contain the specified key are considered to have value 0 for the key. Note that keys may map to negative values!
# Here's an example use case: each of your records contains data about a school student. You can use min_by_key to answer questions such as "who is the youngest student?" and "who is the student with the lowest grade-point average?"
# Implementation notes:
# You should handle an empty array of records in an idiomatic way in your language of choice.
# If several records share the same minimum value for the chosen key, you may return any of them.



# Step 2: first_by_key
# Our next step in database development is to add a new function. We'll call this function first_by_key. It has much in common with min_by_key.  first_by_key takes three arguments:
# a string key
# a string sort direction (which must be either "asc" or "desc")
# an array of records, just as in min_by_key.
# If the sort direction is "asc", then we should return the minimum record, otherwise we should return the maximum record. As before, records without a value for the key should be treated as having value 0.
# Once you have a working solution, you should re-implement min_by_key in terms of first_by_key .


# Step 3: first_by_key comparator
# As we build increasingly rich orderings for our records, we'll find it useful to extract the comparison of records into a comparator. This is a function or object (depending on your language) which determines if a record is "less than", equal, or "greater than" another.
# In object-oriented languages, you should write a class whose constructor accepts two parameters: a string key and a string direction. The class should implement a method compare that takes as its parameters two records. This method should return -1 if the first record comes before the second record (according to key and direction), zero if neither record comes before the other, or 1 if the first record comes after the second.
# In functional languages, you should write a function which accepts two parameters: a string key and a string direction. The function should return a method that takes as its parameters two records. This function should return -1 if the first record comes before the second record (according to key and direction), zero if neither record comes before the other, or 1 if the first record comes after the second.
# You should then use your comparator in your implementation of first_by_key.
