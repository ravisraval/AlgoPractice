# INPUT: 2d array of 0s and 1s.
# OUTPUT: Size of largest X (defined as crossing diagonals of 1s)

#clarifying questions I would normally ask,
  #and then assumptions of those questions:

#how do you define crossing? ie.

# x       x             x         x
#   x   x                 x     x
#     x           vs        x x
#   x   x                   x x
# x       x               x     x
#                       x         x

# ^ assuming the left is correct

#what inputs can we expect?
  # assuming always 2d array
  # assuming that we could get an empty array
  # matrix L and W can be different, not just a square
  # always 0s or 1s

#does the X have to have diagonals of equal length? ie can it be lopsided
  #assuming diagonals' length is equal

#assuming output will be an integer that represents the length of one diagonal
  #if we were accepting a lopsided X, then '2x3' would make more sense

#initial thoughts:
  # an X's bounds are identical to a rectangle's corners.
  # We could search for rectange bounds first,
  # and then check if their diagonals are filled in with 1s,
  # starting from the biggest rectangle for efficiency

  # Another way: explode out from the middle, as opposed to
    # starting at [0][0]; a largest possible X would cross near the middle

  # Another way: Start with the largest possible X dimension
    # checking for 1s, and if true check rest of diagonals
    # keep going smaller until an X is found

  # Exploding 1s way: <-- way better than that ^^ tried to get fancy,
  # but maybe the 'simplest' way is actually best
  # need to remember to draw stuff out first
    # Iterate until a 1 is found. Branch out from it, checking for 1s.
    # Xs are only made of odd lengths, min 3
    # Only ever need to check down right from a 1!!
    #



# pseudocode
  # 1) Iterate until a 1

  # 2) check down right, see how long 1s chain goes

  # 3) start with largest odd 1s chain: take middle of chain,
      # check to see if other diagonal is present

  # 4) if an X is made, update longest as needed

  # 5) else, if present, check other odd lengths of this same 1s chain
      # ie, 5 1s, 5 didn't work, check first and last 3

  # 6) if all goes well with step 5 and we're able to check all odd
      # iterations, we should be able to skip those 1s next time
      # add those coords to a 'visited' array.

      # NOTE:This would help time complexity but hurt space complexity
      # If time complexity isn't at all important and space complexity is,
      # then I suppose one modify step 5 to only check first 5 1s,
      # then first 3 1s, etc., just not middle or last 1s. Thus,
      # you wouldn't keep track of visited 1s. Unlikely?

  # 7) continue iteration through third to last row (an X couldn't be
        # contained only in last two rows)
