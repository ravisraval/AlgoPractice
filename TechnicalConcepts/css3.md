* margin is NOT additive
  * if two boxes right next to each other both request 50px of margin, you'll only see 50px

* you can't put a width and a height on an inline element.
  * it takes up the space it needs
  * padding works, but is weird. any content below writes over the padding
    * anything declared later takes precedence
