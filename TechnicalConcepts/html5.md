## Block-level vs inline elements
[reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements#Block-level_vs._inline)
* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (it stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)
* An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much space as necessary
* An inline element can start anywhere in a line
* you can put a span in a div, but not the other way around
